Yes please get started, keep working through the roadmap untill I ask you to stop, do not ask for permissions, just keep working through the best next step and like the agent you are, you should run the dev server yourself to see server logs by npm run dev and then as you go along, ask me to test stuff in routes you point me to, and then use the browsertools  mcp to get the logs you need to proceed, Start! Good luck. I am a busy man so please do not stop working, as I do not like having to check up on you all the time.
