<!-- Slide number: 3 -->

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY

 YET NO DEDICATED TOOLS EXIST TO ASSIST THEM

INTRODUCING

BOARDAISSISTANT.AI

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->

# THE WHY
Directors are responsible for organizational oversight, stakeholder management, strategic goals, good financial health and legal compliance.
Super human capabilities are required to be able to oversee all aspects of a business
Board members are subject to substantial unlimited personal liability – even for areas where they are not the experts
Legal requirements are unclear
Board material is often substantial and demands detailed review
Directors are often very skilled profesionals – but with a busy agenda

<!-- Slide number: 5 -->

# THE SOLUTION
AI powered system can:
Increase speed of review of board material
Catch inconsistencies, lack of details etc.
Assist board members to ensure that all relevant topics are covered
Document review for future use (including defence file and evidence that director is diligent)
Provide additional value to board member input

Result:
Reduced risk of liability and enhanced director performance

<!-- Slide number: 6 -->

# Description of system when finalized (i.e. full version)
AI powered board assistant helping board members review extensive board material:
Review of material in light of most relevant topics expected by BoD review
Inconsistencies in material
Variations to material from previous board meetings
Incongruence with corporate and compliance policies (e.g. CEO instruction, ESG etc.)
Missing information (based on best practice requirements to board material)
E.g. financial info, seasonal comparisons, risks and opportunities etc.
Illogical or unfounded conclusions
Suggestions for improvements
Non-AI features
Easy access to material (repository)
Access to prior reports and actions (e.g. emails to  management) to secure traceability and act as defense file

In future, the assistant may include additional features:
V.1.5 – local legislation adaptations/local language versions
V.2 – tradespecific particulars (e.g. shipping, retail etc.)
V.3 – Business advice (Eg. ROI not on par with industry, marketing expense too high vs. peers etc.)

Find mistakes and inconsistencies in current uploads

<!-- Slide number: 13 -->

# Technical featuresReview current uploads for missing information against best practice board material
Review current uploads against system pre-defined best practice documents and suggest what is missing
System needs to be able to understand that e.g. minutes should not contain the same amount of information/topics as what will be included in pre-reads – uploads to be made in specific categories (e.g. financial information, general pre-read, minutes etc.)?

<!-- Slide number: 14 -->

# Technical featuresReport and email generator

Granularity – how much detail do we want (e.g. not comma mistakes)
If I ask chatGPT for a report I can ask again for a more detailed report and get more info – need to prompt at right level.
Report generated on UI in clear sections with right headings
For each report section there needs to be following clear options:
”delete section from report”
”manual change of wording in section”
Ask AI to amend section text
Generate email text
Download report

# Notes to DEMO

<!-- Slide number: 20 -->
# Scope of DEMO version
DEMO must include following:
Based on ChatGPT or other similar LLM as the underlying AI software, the DEMO should be able to accept upload of PDF material  and provide ”buttons” for clicking to move to next step and/or prompt LLM to provide data.
Slides 4+5 show the interfaces needed. Certain features will not be active so only those listed below should be active.

DEMO features:
Remotely accessible interface (web page/link) with access to:
1. Interfaces as included in slides 4+5 (design can be altered but content should be close)
2. ability to upload material to LLM (step 1)
3. press button”data crunch options” – (step 2)
4. move to next page and press  button ”Data inconsistency” – (step 3)
5. when ”data inconsistency” is pressed prompt LLM to search uploaded documents for data inconsistencies [prompts to be defined in more detail later so we get right prompts pre-programmed]
6. provide interface with step 4 page – content from LLM data inconsistency search (Step 4)
7. press button ”add to report to management – Yes” (step 4)
8. provide interface with draft email to CEO [prompts to LLM to be defined to get right draft text] (step 5)

EMAIL GENERATOR
Dear CEO,

Thanks for forwarding the board material for the board meeting on xx/xx/xxxx.

I have reviewed the material and have a few questions and comments that I would like you to consider prior to the meeting:

Observation 1:
Section A, p.17: growth amounts to 15% YoY
Section B, p. 3: In our largest markets we are growing by more than 17% this year
Is there some inconsistency in the growth numbers as growth in largest markets exceed the total growth?
Should we be concerned about growth in smaller markets pulling down overall growth?
