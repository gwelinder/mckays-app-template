# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes

Ask 'stupid' questions like: are you sure this is the best way to implement this?

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

## Scraptpad

You MUST actively use the [scratchpad.md](mdc:mckays-app-template/mckays-app-template/docs/scratchpad.md) file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

## Overview

This is a web app template.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Framer Motion
- Backend: Postgres, Supabase, Drizzle ORM, Server Actions
- Auth: Clerk
- Payments: Stripe
- Analytics: PostHog
- Deployment: Vercel

## Project Structure

- `actions` - Server actions
  - `db` - Database related actions
  - Other actions
- `app` - Next.js app router
  - `api` - API routes
  - `route` - An example route
    - `_components` - One-off components for the route
    - `layout.tsx` - Layout for the route
    - `page.tsx` - Page for the route
- `components` - Shared components
  - `ui` - UI components
  - `utilities` - Utility components
- `db` - Database
  - `schema` - Database schemas
- `lib` - Library code
  - `hooks` - Custom hooks
- `prompts` - Prompt files
- `public` - Static assets
- `types` - Type definitions

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- Use `@` to import anything from the app unless otherwise specified
- Use kebab case for all files and folders unless otherwise specified
- Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified

#### Env Rules

- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

#### Type Rules

Follow these rules when working with types.

- When importing types, use `@/types`
- Name files like `example-types.ts`
- All types should go in `types`
- Make sure to export the types in `types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- If referring to db types, use `@/db/schema` such as `SelectTodo` from `todos-schema.ts`

An example of a type:

`types/actions-types.ts`

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

And exporting it:

`types/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./actions-types"
```
