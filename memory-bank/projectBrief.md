# Project context

Board members must review voluminous and complex documentation under time pressure. Manual review risks oversight, resulting in misinformed decisions and increased liability. Additionally, inconsistent report generation and lack of transparency hamper accountability.

Our vision is to create a highly efficient, intelligent, and transparent assistant that:

- Automates the detection of errors and inconsistencies.
- Provides actionable, traceable insights.
- Evolves its prompts through continuous feedback and observability.
- Enhances decision-making while reducing board liability risk.
