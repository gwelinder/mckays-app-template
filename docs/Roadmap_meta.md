   <roadmap_outline>

- Look for Requirements and Dependencies Review all relevant documents to gather requirements and constraints:
- project-plan/

# Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture Setup - Establish overall goals and constraints from @/knowledge-base/docs/PRD.md and @/knowledge-base/docs/SRS.md

Clarify architecture for the project (no full infrastructure setup needed).

# Phase 2: Iterative Feature Development

For each feature below, follow these steps:
