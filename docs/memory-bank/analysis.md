# BoardAIssistant.com - Current State Analysis

## Project Overview

BoardAIssistant.com is an AI-powered board assistant designed for Scandinavian board members to streamline the review of extensive board materials while reducing liability risks. The system focuses on detecting data inconsistencies, missing information, and illogical conclusions, optimized for local legislative requirements and governance practices.

   - Standardized error handling and validation
   - SSE for progress tracking
   - Proper file type validation

2. **Storage Integration**

   - Supabase storage for file management
   - Proper path structure: `${userId}/${companyId}/${filename}`
   - File metadata tracking
   - Access control validation

3. **Analysis Pipeline**
   - Streaming response support
   - Progress tracking with SSE
   - Type-safe request validation
   - Proper error handling

### Current Limitations

1. **Processing**

   - Limited file type support
   - No batch processing
   - Basic metadata extraction

2. **Storage**

   - No file versioning
   - Limited file type validation
   - Basic metadata support

3. **Analysis**
   - Basic progress tracking
   - Limited analysis tools
   - No caching mechanism

### Next Steps Priority

1. **Immediate**

   - Fix validation import error
   - Complete document processing pipeline
   - Implement analysis tools

2. **Short-term**

   - Add file versioning
   - Enhance metadata extraction
   - Implement caching

3. **Long-term**
   - Add batch processing
   - Enhance analysis capabilities
   - Improve error handling

### Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**

   - Move validation to shared location
   - Standardize error responses
   - Improve type definitions

2. **Testing**

   - Add unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Add error case tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Add error handling guide

This analysis serves as a living document and will be updated as we progress through the implementation.
